    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Decision Tree:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world application can be in the Artificial Intelligence industry and also the Robotic industry. When the company want to design a cleanning robot, they can use decision tree to program this robot to let it to make the simply and easy choise to clean the dust or not, and where to clean.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The strengths of this model is: \n",
    "Very easy to interpret and explain. People can use decision tree to categorize the data.\n",
    "Can be displayed graphically. Make the data more visual.\n",
    "Can deal with interactions of variables.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The weakness of this model is:\n",
    "Decision Trees may not be as accurate as other classification algorithms as they have tendency to “overfit” the data (meaning they make excellent predictions within the data set used to train them, but poorer predictions for new data coming in). Nonetheless, there are various methods of “pruning” the tree to improve accuracy.\n",
    "Decision Trees are not an online technique, meaning the whole tree must be recreated from scratch in order to incorporate new data, since the variables that optimally split the data could change.\n",
    "With larger data sets the number of nodes on a decision tree can grow extremely large and complex, resulting in slow classifications. It can generate noise.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is a good candidate for the problem:\n",
    "Since a decision tree can handle both numerical and categorical data, it’s a good candidate for our case.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ensemble Methods(Adboost)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**This technique became popular after the Netflix Challenge where the winning teams used ensembles of a lot of models to win the competition. This challenge aimed to build a new recommender system for Netflix to propose new movies for their users. And AdaBoost is best used to boost the performance of decision trees on binary classification problems.[reference](https://machinelearningmastery.com/boosting-and-adaboost-for-machine-learning/)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The strengths of this model is:\n",
    "Somewhat more interpretable than bagged trees/random forest as the user can define the size of each tree resulting in a collection of stumps (1 level) which can be viewed as an additive model\n",
    "Can easily handle qualitative (categorical) features.[reference](https://github.com/ctufts/Cheat_Sheets/wiki/Classification-Model-Pros-and-Cons) The ensemble method continues to attempt to correct misclassifications in the training data,it can lead a good quality data.[reference](https://machinelearningmastery.com/boosting-and-adaboost-for-machine-learning/) Another reason is since adboost method will select the strongest learner in all the weak learners. And eliminate the weak part of the model and select the strong part, repeat this process until it finds the best suit model which cannot improve anymore. It is very good for the imbalance dataset.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The weakness of this model is:\n",
    "Unconstrained, individual trees are prone to overfitting because they can keep branching until they memorize the training data. However, this can be alleviated by using ensembles. It can generate noise.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it can be a candidate for this problem:\n",
    "Ensemble methods I understand is very similar to decision tree model, it can classify the both numerical and categorical data, and do even deeper by using the random forest. It can be right for our case.**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Real world application:Face detection – SVMc classify parts of the image as a face and non-face and create a square boundary around the face.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The advantage of this model is:\n",
    "Firstly it has a regularisation parameter, which makes the user think about avoiding over-fitting. Secondly it uses the kernel trick, so you can build in expert knowledge about the problem via engineering the kernel. Thirdly an SVM is defined by a convex optimisation problem (no local minima) for which there are efficient methods (e.g. SMO). Lastly, it is an approximation to a bound on the test error rate, and there is a substantial body of theory behind it which suggests it should be a good idea.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The weakness of this model is:\n",
    "The disadvantages are that the theory only really covers the determination of the parameters for a given value of the regularisation and kernel parameters and choice of kernel. In a way the SVM moves the problem of over-fitting from optimising the parameters to model selection.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it can be a candidate for this problem:\n",
    "Because this model can create a kernel to fit better the data, also do excellent job with more than 2 dimensions.**"

We are interested in knowing the best combination or which are the most powerful feature will influence on the income. So Adboost model might choose a combination of age, occupation and capital loss, then it calculate that the combination will be likely 30% of probability lead the person has more than 50k income. So Adboost go to choose age, occupation and hour per week, then the probability of the person earn more than 50k become 35%, which is better than the previous combination. It goes to another features, let´s say age, capital gain, occupation, hours of week and capital loss. The probablity is 55%. So the Adaboost will repeat the testing process until it find the highest probability to predict the people who can earn more than 50k.

In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

    "**These 5 features shows by the model are definitely out of my expectation, but 4 of my guess were right, even though they were not on the right orden. I would say my answer is not exactly like my guess, but I can understand why the answer chose capital loss (20% of the feature weight) as the most relevant reason to influence on the income, because the more profit/assets you lose then you have less income, the same way for capital gain (3rd place,8% of the feature weight), more profit/asset you gain, you have more income. I would not guess the age (18% of the feature weight) as the second most important feature since is really depends on the work but generally the older people have more experience then you tend to have higher income. Hours per week is tricky, because in the real life, it does not always happen that you work more and gain more. It really depends on the work you do, for example, in consulting company, people usually work more than 60 hours per week but they do not earn the wage according to the hours. Education is the 5th, it makes sense it is the one of the top 5 features, higher education you receive, you might get better job.**"

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
